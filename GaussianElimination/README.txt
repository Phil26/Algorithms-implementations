C++ implementation of Gaussian elimination method.

In mathematics, Gaussian elimination, also known as row reduction, is an algorithm for solving systems of linear equations.

It consists of a sequence of operations performed on the corresponding matrix of coefficients. This method can also be used to compute the rank of a matrix, the determinant of a square matrix, and the inverse of an invertible matrix.
